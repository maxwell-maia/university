This was a year long group project. 4 Members. Our group, with permission from the lecturer, went above and beyond the requirement of making website app... We made a 3D first person shooter video game that runs in the browser.


It was created in a software called PlayCanvas. I implemented some of the core features of the game. In this repository are some javascript files that I wrote for the game. I did further development in PlayCanvas itself.


See the final project report in this repository for details.
