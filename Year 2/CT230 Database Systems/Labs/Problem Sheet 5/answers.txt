wrong answer maybe
This one is wrong.
SELECT dfName, dSurname, fName, surname
FROM (((movie INNER JOIN directs ON movieID = mID) INNER JOIN director ON dID = directorID) INNER JOIN stars ON movieID = mID) INNER JOIN actor ON actorID = aID
WHERE title = "Don't Look Up"




right answerscopy
This one is wrong.
(
SELECT dfName, dSurname
FROM (movie INNER JOIN directs ON directs.movieID = mID) INNER JOIN director ON dID = directorID
WHERE title = "Don't Look Up"
)

UNION

(
SELECT fName, surname
FROM (movie INNER JOIN stars ON stars.movieID = mID) INNER JOIN actor ON aID = stars.movieID
WHERE title = "Don't Look Up"
)

LOL RIGHT ANSWER WAS IN ME
This one is right. concat is optional
SELECT CONCAT (dfName, " ", dSurname) AS director, CONCAT (fName, " ", surname) AS actor
FROM (((movie INNER JOIN directs ON directs.movieID = mID) INNER JOIN director ON dID = directorID) INNER JOIN stars ON stars.movieID = mID) INNER JOIN actor ON actorID = aID
WHERE title = "Don't Look Up"
